<h3>Usage Instructions</h3>
<pre><code data-language="swig">{% include template_path %}
{% include "path/to/template.js" %}</code></pre>

<p>You can mark an include to <code>ignore missing</code> so that if the template does not exist, it will be ignored and no error will be thrown.</p>

<pre><code data-language="swig">{% include "foobar.html" ignore missing %}</code></pre>

<p>Locally declared context variables are _not_ passed to the included template by default. For example, in the following situations, your <code>inc.html</code> will not know about the variables <code>foo</code> nor <code>bar</code>:</p>

<pre><code data-language="swig">{% set foo = "bar" %}
{% include "inc.html" %}

{% for bar in thing %}
    {% include "inc.html" %}
{% endfor %}</code></pre>

<p>In order to have your included template get these locally declared variables, you can use the <code>with</code> argument, followed by an object that will create the context of the included template:</p>

<pre><code data-language="swig">{% set foo = { bar: "baz" } %}
{% include "inc.html" with foo %}

{% for bar in thing %}
    {% include "inc.html" with bar %}
{% endfor %}</code></pre>

<p>You can also use the <code>only</code> argument to restrict the context to the variables that you explicitly define.</p>

<p>Assume that your current context has variables <code>bar</code> and <code>foo</code> available. In the following situation, only <code>foo</code> will be defined in your <code>inc.html</code>:</p>

<pre><code data-language="swig">{% include "inc.html" with foo only %}</code></pre>

<p>The <code>only</code> argument <em>must</em> be passed as the last argument in the tag. Any other placement will not work.</p>
